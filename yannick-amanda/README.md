#Lab 06: Ajax and JSON

**Author**: Yannick Aspesberro & Amanada Moen
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application uses AJAX to grab the local storage data, and renders it into the blog.  If local storage doesn't exist, it will pull the data from the attached JSON file and render that data onto the HTML, and pushes to local storage.

## Getting Started
Must run the page in live server in order for the page to run correctly.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, live server, etc.

## Change Log
Wrote the function that checks if local storage exists, if it doesn't, then pull the data from the file, and if it exists, grab it from local storage and render it to the HTML.
Got the function up and running, no bugs/errors in the console. (Didn't run properly until we tried it on live server.)
